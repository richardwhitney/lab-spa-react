## Hospital Laboratory Information and E-Learning Tool
Name: Richard Whitney  
### Overview
This project was submitted as my final year project for the HDip in Computer Science in WIT.  
  
The goal of this project was to develop a web application for clinicians to provide assistance and information regarding hospital laboratory diagnostic services provided on site at St. Luke’s Hospital Kilkenny.  
When a doctor graduates from college they are assigned to different hospitals around the country in order to complete a one-year internship. After six months they are assigned to another hospital to complete the final six months of their internship. This means that every six months St. Luke’s hospital receives a new batch of junior doctors that are unaware of the correct procedures to access the laboratory diagnostic services. This can lead to mistakes and delays in the processing of laboratory results.  
The laboratory in SLGH (St. Luke’s General Hospital) is accredited to ISO 15189 and as part of the pre-analytical requirements of the standard, the laboratory must provide comprehensive information to all service users in the form of a handbook or a user manual. As well as meeting the requirements of ISO 15189 a comprehensive user manual can be a very useful resource for all the Non Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) as they rotate frequently between different hospitals.  
Currently this is addressed by providing a link on the hospital intranet lab enquiry page. This link is to a PDF document which is over 60 pages. Although it addresses all the requirements of ISO 15189,  laboratory staff have expressed a desire to move to a new system.  
The new system provides doctors with an application that is accessible through a web browser. The application allows doctors to find the information they need quickly and easily. The application allows laboratory management to update procedures, information, clinical pathways, and training modules to keep information up to date in accordance with best practises.
